## üåü Introduction

Welcome to the NUDAR (Nuclear Detection, Ranging, and Mapping) repository by [Ultralytics](https://www.ultralytics.com/)! This project offers sophisticated simulation tools crafted for modeling the Earth's structure and simulating [neutrino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino) detector systems. Grounded in scientific research, our tools cater to both the academic community and applied sciences within [geophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics) and [particle physics](https://home.cern/science/physics/particle-physics). Explore the fascinating intersection of earth modeling and neutrino detection with NUDAR! üåç‚ú®

## üìú Description

NUDAR provides a comprehensive suite of [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) simulations designed to advance the theoretical study of [antineutrino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antineutrino) interactions and detection. This software is instrumental in deepening our understanding of antineutrino properties and their potential applications, such as probing the [Earth's interior](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/encyclopedia/earths-interior/) and enhancing nuclear detection capabilities.

Our development is inspired by the foundational paper by G. Jocher et al., "Theoretical Antineutrino Detection, Direction and Ranging at Long Distances," published in [Physics Reports](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/physics-reports) (Volume 527, Issue 3, 2013). For an in-depth look at the scientific principles underpinning these simulations, please consult the publication via its DOI: [http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physrep.2013.01.005](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physrep.2013.01.005). You can find more insights into related fields on the [Ultralytics Blog](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog).

## üß∞ Requirements

To utilize the NUDAR simulations, ensure you have MATLAB (version 2018a or later) installed. The simulations also rely on a common functions repository, which must be accessible within your MATLAB environment.

Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1.  Clone the Common Functions repository for MATLAB:
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/functions-matlab
    ```
2.  Add the cloned repository to your MATLAB path using the following command:
    ```matlab
    addpath(genpath('/path/to/functions-matlab')) % Replace /path/to/ with the actual path
    ```

**Note:** The following MATLAB toolboxes are also required:

-   [Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/statistics.html)
-   [Signal Processing Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/signal.html)
-   [Mapping Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/mapping.html)

Ensure you have the necessary licenses for these toolboxes, obtainable through official [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/) channels.

## üöÄ Running the Simulation

To start the Interactive Detector Neutrino Direction and Ranging (iDND) tool, execute the following command in the MATLAB command window:

```matlab
iDND
```

This command launches the simulation interface, enabling exploration of various neutrino detection scenarios and earth model configurations. For more on simulation techniques, check resources on [computational modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_model).
