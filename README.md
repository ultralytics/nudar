## üåü Introduction

Welcome to the NUDAR (Nuclear Detection, Ranging, and Mapping) repository! Here, we provide advanced simulation tools designed for modeling the Earth's structure and simulating neutrino detector systems. Our work is built upon a foundation of scientific research and is geared towards both the academic community and applied sciences in the field of geophysics and particle physics.

## üìú Description

The NUDAR project is a comprehensive suite of MATLAB simulations aimed at facilitating the theoretical study of antineutrino interactions and detections. This software plays a crucial role in enhancing our understanding of antineutrino properties and their applications in probing the Earth's interior and nuclear detection.

Our work is inspired and informed by the seminal paper by G. Jocher et al., titled "Theoretical Antineutrino Detection, Direction and Ranging at Long Distances," published in Physics Reports (Volume 527, Issue 3, 2013). For a deep dive into the scientific and theoretical backgrounds that underpin these simulations, please refer to the publication at:

## üß∞ Requirements

To get started with the NUDAR simulations, ensure that you have MATLAB (version 2018a or later) set up on your machine. Additionally, the simulations depend on a repository of common functions which should be included in your MATLAB environment.

Please follow these steps to prepare your work environment:

1. Clone the Common Functions repository for MATLAB:
   ```shell
   $ git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/functions-matlab
   ```
2. Add the repository to your MATLAB path by running:
   ```matlab
   >> addpath(genpath('/functions-matlab'))
   ```
   
**Note:** You should also have the following toolboxes installed in your MATLAB environment:
- `Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox`
- `Signal Processing Toolbox`
- `Mapping Toolbox`

Required licenses for these toolboxes should be acquired through official MATLAB channels.

## üöÄ Running the Simulation

To launch the Interactive Detector Neutrino Direction and Ranging (iDND) tool, simply navigate to the MATLAB command window and enter:
```matlab
>> iDND
```
This command will initiate the simulation interface, allowing you to explore various neutrino detection scenarios and earth model configurations.
